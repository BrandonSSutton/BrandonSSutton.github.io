                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people with mental illness are looked down upon. Those with depression are seen as seeking attention, and those with ADHD are seen as making excuses, all by those who truly believe that mental illness do not really exist. Then there are those who have difficulty understanding why someone would act or feel a certain way because they themselves never have, or those who think a mental illness should look a different way, and those suffering should act a certain way 100% of the time. All of these issues stem from a common cause, a lack of education. I believe that if we were to educate people on mental illnesses, we would see a change in how people react to it. Even though there is already a plethora of information readily available to people on the internet. I propose we require it of K12 school to include a method for which students are able to seek information about mental illnesses. This could be implemented a number of ways. The most affective way would be to hold a proper class dedicated to teaching kids the basic information about various mental illnesses and educating them on where to turn if they’re going through something. However, this would not be very cost-effective. From a cost-effective standpoint, the next best option would be to provide the information through the office. The administrators could hand students or parents who desire the information a list of reputable sources in which they can properly learn from, along with a list of places to refer someone when they are experiencing mental health issues. These places would be written by category detailing where one should go depending on what mental disorder they may be living with. For example, if someone is experiencing depression, they could be referred to a therapist.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During orientation, the staff could inform the new students or parents of where they would be able to obtain the information. The administrators would have to make if very clear that this would be completely confidential. I believe this is a reasonable solution. This not only minimizes the amount of money being spent on the subject and provides a way for people to learn more about an unfortunate issue. This solution also can stand up to possible objections. The school is merely offering the information for the children as apposed to forcing students to learn about a subject that may upset some parents. There will be absolutely nothing that requires a student to seek the information, however, if one desires to understand more about mental illnesses, the information will be readily available in the office. This solution is better than any other solution I have thought of to date. The other solutions I have thought of not only would be far less cost-effective but would be difficult to implement and would not standup to objections from parents of students. Other solutions included incorporating a lesson into the already existing health class and creating a class dedicated to educated on mental health issues. This solution also is better than simply expecting students to do their own research, this way the students are given a list of information that has data backing it up.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues I can don’t see this solution solving are that perhaps students may feel uncomfortable about seeking out the information. If someone is suffering from a mental illness, they may not want their peers to know in fear of being made fun of. Perhaps the parents of a student would be displeased with their child having obtained information they may perceive as toxic information poisoning their minds. However, these issues cannot fall back on the school as the school is not forcing this information upon the students, it simply makes the information available. It is completely up to the students whether or not they want to obtain the information. This is the best solution to the problem given the guidelines.
