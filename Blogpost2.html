                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My topic still is and will remain focused on creating more awareness for mental health issues. However,  I now have expanded my the lengths I will reach for it. I have discovered sources that offer a different perspective, and because of this, I have been able to state a different take on what causes issues, and what affects they may bring. I have also been able to find ways of early detection of depression in children based on their reading scores from a study that took place in India.

                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example of what I have learned comes from a study held in New Zealand, this study concerned how their worklife affected their personal lives. The study found a link between job satisfaction and life satisfaction, as stress appeared to be affecting the workers relationships. The study concluded that the best thing for these workers to do would be to have adequate time off, and mental health professionals ready. However the issue arose that men did not want to come forward in fear of being labeled as a wimp. The study shows that these issues need to be taken seriously, and shows what happens when stress is not managed. Another article from the Mediterranean Journal of Humanities  disscusses how isolation affects the human mind. Living in a world where is seems like no one cares, and there are no societal norms, it becomes difficult for someone to understand how they fit in. due to this, one can develop feelings of isolation. This isolation can result in feelings of depression, and hallucinations. These things combined can cause one to believe they will start to think they are not welcome in society, and will recede more. The issue with this is that the more they recede, the worse their depression gets. The reason this depression sets in, is because humans are naturally social animals, we need to be social at least occasionally so we do not go insane, hence the hallucinations.

                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third source I ran across in my research comes with a religious stand point from the Four Major Psychiatric Journals.  This study looked at the affects of religion on mental health. While religion was not found to have any affects on the amount of mental health issues, it did affect how many people were willing to seek help for it.  The study showed that people who where not religious were more likely to seek help from a professional, and were more likely to get better. Those who followed a religion were far less likely to seek help, and if they did, it was always a religious psychologist, who tried to solve their issues through religion. However not all things can be solved by simply praying, sometimes we need to be able to get proper medication, and or make the proper changes in life in order to get better. Religious families tend to be more judgmental, making it harder to not only get help, but to carry out what the help is advising these poor people to do in order to get better.

                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final source I will discuss today concerned fly-in fly-out employees. These are people that some from all over for work. It is found through the study that these people undergo high rates of suicide. And according to the article a large number of these are work related. Unfortunately most of these workers are men, and society tells men they are supposed to be strong, so they do not seek help for their issues. There were professionals hired to help these individuals, however, it is difficult to help them, if they are too afraid of coming forward and admitting they need help. How do you offer a safe environment for those who need help without them feeling as if they are being week by seeking this help? You can’t, even if you provide complete confidentiality and assure them that it is the right thing to do, men would rather suffer than look bad in the public eye. <p ALIGN=RIGHT>Feb, 23</p>
