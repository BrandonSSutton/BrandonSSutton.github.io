                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To start off, I want to be clear that this post is personal. It is only here to offer insight on what it's like to live in my head. Now on to the post.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I live every out my days just like any other person really. I get up, I shower, I go to work or school, I do my work, then I go to bed. Seems pretty normal right? Well here is what you don't see... Behind my eyes, everything is a little different. I wake up in the morning and I have to phsycially attempt to find a reason to get out of bed, I have to force myself to shower. I have trouble falling asleep because I can't subdue my head. I feel absolutely worthless, and it doesn't matter how much I try to tell myself otherwise, or how often my friends tell me otherwise... The voices in my head have a lot more pull than anyone else.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see I hear voices and see things that aren't there, some people would call me crazy... Many people have, and some people stop trusting me after they learn this about me. Maybe their right to feel that way, I don't know. What I do know is these voices in my head are very real to me and they are not very kind. I have always held myself to a higher standard than I could even feasibly reach, thus I constantly feel like im not enough no matter how well I do on anything. I can look myself in the mirror, tell myself that I a good person, but I never believe it. How messed up is that? I don't believe the works comming out of my own mouth.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I contatnly apologize even when there's no real reason to. About three months ago, I was told that I was a burden on someone's life. Whether that was true or not, and whether I deserved it or not, I can't help but to feel it was true. I think about it every day, and it drags me down everytime i do. I'm constantly told to not live in the past, but I don't know how to live any other way. I like to pretend that I'm strong and even will go as far as to be "void of emotion", but really that's just a front I put up in order to stop people from trying to ask me questions. It sucks not feeling like you're worth anything and not wanting to continue living if it means you're only going to feel like the a useless bag of garbage.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My apologize for this post. I know its a little depression, but its 03:00, I can't sleep and I felt like some insight might do my readers some good.
