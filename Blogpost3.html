                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I chose to go with the option of Duoethnography. I went with this option, because I wanted to give someone battling a mental health disorder a chance to speak out and give their view point on this. Since I know a few people that battle mental health, I figured this would be the easiest method to carry out, and considering all that has happened in the last two weeks, It was much easier to conduct an interview over a chat platform, than to attempt to observe someone out in public. Luckily, at least one person I know was comfortable discussing her ADHD, and did not mind my curiosity.
            
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke with a friend of mine, her name is Aubrey. The reason I decided to speak with her, is because I knew that she would be the least busy out of my friends, and I knew she was comfortable talking about these kinds of things. Questions I asked included: how do people act when they first meet you vs having known you for a while, How do your friends act vs your parents, how is everyday life like with ADHD. With  these questions I got some really interesting answers. I conducted this interview online, since I had no other options at the time. 
            
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot say I enjoyed the field work process. It felt to me like I was more doing this for research than for my own curiosity, and that made it feel like more work than it should have, but I cannot say I would have done this any differently. The interview went smoothly, and the hours time went by relatively quickly. It was not difficult to come up with questions I needed to ask, or to weed out what information was most important. It probably went smoother considering I was talking to a friend instead of a stranger.
            
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My field work does help to inform my topic, because It fills in gaps between what the research I have found says, and what a someones personal experience with the disorder is like. For instance, the research says that people have difficulty focusing, but it is unclear how that really affects someone in every day life, Aubrey showed that its like unable to focus on what you want to focus on, so when she is trying to focus. This can affect one when attempting to find a job, or clean their house, or complete a task at an existing job. Which can lead to loss of said job, an unsanitary environment, or could even cause anxiety. My expectations were denied with ADHD, I expected it to be similar to a huge issue, but that is not always the case. Sometimes ADHD is a huge issue, and people are bouncing off the walls, but most of the time, that is not the case. And in Aubrey’s case, one can calm down over time. 
            
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can use this information in my data bank to show how a mental disorder may affect individuals differently. There is always a common stigma that goes along with most mental disorders, and usually, there are key signs that people look for. As Aubrey showed me, those stigmas are rarely accurate, and the signs that most people look for aren’t displayed by everyone. While one person may display 3-4 symptoms of a mental illness, the person to the left may display all, and the person to the right may only display one. That doesn’t mean that one person is more likely to have the disorder over the other, it just means that there is more too it than just looking for key symptoms. Aubrey explained that she used to be super high energy, bouncing off the walls as one usually expected from someone from ADHD, however as she has gotten older, she has mellowed out a lot and because of this, I would not know she has ADHD just by looking at her, it would take a lot of time spent with her to even come close to realizing she does. <p ALIGN=RIGHT>March, 27</p>
