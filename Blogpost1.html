          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My write for change topic is centered around mental health awareness. I chose this topic for multiple reasons The most notable reason is that mental health issues are the leading cause of suicide in our country. I want to try to to alleviate that by educating the majority about mental illnesses. 
                 
                 Another reason I chose this topic, is there is a shocking number of people living in America that believe mental health issues are all made up for an excuse not to do work. While yes it is true that some people do pretend to have a condition in order to get out of doing work, I hope to show these people that the majority of people who say they have a certain issue, actually have it. I will accomplish this through explaining the facts, symptoms, and common actions of those with various mental health issues. On the other side of that I will also be going into detail on how one might fake these symptoms and what you should look for in general to tell if someone really has a condition or not. I aim to educate everyone on how mental illness operate, and show how we can help those who experience these issues. I may even shed light on the subject for someone who thinks they may have an issue, making them realize that maybe that is not the case after all. And for those suffering through something, perhaps this will make them realize that they are not alone, and can go talk to someone. Often times the biggest issue is we don’t know who we can talk too. I will be answer that question in my research as well. 
                 
                 This topic has affected my life in more ways than one. The first example I have to offer would be my friend. We will call him Jim. Jim has depression and although he is on medication for it, it does not always work. Sometimes I will receive messages or calls from Jim, saying how he feels like life is pointless, and nobody cares about him, and he doesn’t feel like he would be missed if he just ended it all right now. I do my best to assure him that I would miss him, as would many other people. However, this is difficult to explain to someone who has depression as they feel so low, and may even think that you are lieing to make them feel better. 
                 
                 My next example goes back to when I was a young boy back in elementary school. I had a young friend we will call Bob. Bob had Asperger syndrome. He was a little awkward around people, and didn’t really understand right from wrong in the same way you or I would. Bob was a really kind person, and a great friend, he was just a little slower, and a little different. One had to be more patient with Bob as to not upset him, or to help him understand why something is the way it is. People who experience Asperger’s, they sometimes do not understand that there is something wrong with them, but there are also high functioning people with Asperger’s who are fully aware they have the syndrome, however, are unable to control it. 
                 
                 My final example would be my uncle who sadly passed away when I was around 7. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He had voices in his head telling him to do awful, awful things. He never thought he could talk about it with anyone, nor did he want to. He was raised in the belief that men do not discuss their issues, so he tried to deal with his issues. He fought for 36 years before ending it all. Leaving his family devastated to find out what he had been going through, knowing we had no clue. Thats how depression works a lot of the time. You would never know that someone in your life is depressed, because they may be smiling all the time, and laughing with you. They never talk about it, because they feel like a burden to you. This is why it is important to give people with mental conditions a way to talk about their issues, and be more aware in general of how these things affect these poor people. 
                 
                 In the future I expect to run into more people with different mental disorders, I have yet to meet anyone with turret’s, or multiple personalities disorder, however if I do, I feel it would be nice to be educated about it more so I don’t accidentally address them in an improper manner. <p ALIGN=RIGHT>Jan, 25</p>
                 <!--January 25th, 2020, saturday night. There's a lot of speculations and preconceived notions of what it means to be schizophrenic. My experience tonight was minimal, I was sitting back in bed, watching some videos on YouTube on my TV. After I had watched somewhere around 8 videos, I noticed a small shadow creature on the wall just behind the TV, that resembles a spider from a video game I play known as Skyrim, A frost-spider is what they are called. These spiders are large, with a bluish black outter skeleton, and white hair protruding at its joints, They have large claws protruding from their mouth and can run at speeds greater than the games characters. However, The claws hanging from its mouth were missing in what I saw. While appearing in this form, the figure appeared to be smiling at me with an a human mouth and a face that was difficult to read. This hallucination although it seems like it is nothing special to the normal person and most would shrug it off as an overactive imagination, This is on the lower end of some of the things I have witnessed, but still very real to me. As this hallucination continued it morphed into the figure of spongebob, that is if spongebob could melt and had his eyes gouged out. With that part of his face was missing, the lower half of him was gone, and his arms seemed bent out of shape. I know what you are thinking, “Brandon this all sounds like you made this up, this can’t be real.” Oh but I assure you it was very real. Imagine seeing something like that multiple times a day every day, But wait,  it gets worse. With all of this having already having manifested its self right before my eyes, I have the luxury of seeing before me what I can only describe as a man with no face, floating on the wall, staring strait at me. How can he stair without a face? I suppose it is similar to how slenderman works.  This figure seemed to hang there for what felt like hours, however it was only in reality about 5 minutes. The entire time making no contact, no gestures, no sign of being real or fake. He simply just exsisted there. After the 5 minutes had passed, he seemed to fade away and shift back into the image of spongebob again, and then after a few seconds it slowly faded away into nothingness. While this is not a scary experience, I does make you have to think about if what I saw was really all in my head, or was it real and I was the only one that saw it. This looked as if it was the end of the hallucinations for the night, and so I preceded to watch a few more videos on youtube, and by 1am I decided it was time for bed. I got off my bed, brushed my teeth, and made sure that everything was in order for me to be able to get up and start working the next morning. As I laid down in bed, pulled my covers over me, closed my eyes and attempted to slip off into dream land, I saw one last thing that would scare most people right out of their skin. Right in front of me where a pair of eyes, and a mouth staring directly into mine, while inching closer and closer until I could feel this “being” right on top of me. I could not tell if this “being” ment harm or not, however, it has been a recurring hallucination. Though it does not happen every night, it happens a large number of them. This “being” just sits there, nose to nose with me, staring into my eyes and never makes a sound. As I stare back, there is unfortunately not much to see. It appears as if I am staring into an abyss, or a deep cavern  for which light never reaches. There are no pupils, nor an iris. Every now and then, the “being” appears with long hair, and a gray skin, a symmetrical face that resembles a woman, and dark, blackish gray irides. I never feel any breath from the creature being leaked out onto my skin. Even if I turn on my side, it does not matter, the “being” seems to float down in front of me, and assumes the same position as before. This will often persists for approximately 2-3 minutes, then just like the hallucinations before it, it dissipates into thin air.-->
