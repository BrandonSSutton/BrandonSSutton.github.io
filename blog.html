      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My write for change topic is centered around mental health awareness. I chose this topic for multiple reasons The most notable reason is that mental health issues are the leading cause of suicide in our country. I want to try to to alleviate that by educating the majority about mental illnesses.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My topic still is and will remain focused on creating more awareness for mental health issues. However, I now have expanded my the lengths I will reach for it. I have discovered sources that offer a different perspective, and because of this, I have been able to state a different take on what causes issues, and what affects they may bring. I have also been able to find ways of early detection of depression in children based on their reading scores from a study that took place in India.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I chose to go with the option of Duoethnography. I went with this option, because I wanted to give someone battling a mental health disorder a chance to speak out and give their view point on this. Since I know a few people that battle mental health, I figured this would be the easiest method to carry out, and considering all that has happened in the last two weeks, It was much easier to conduct an interview over a chat platform, than to attempt to observe someone out in public. Luckily, at least one person I know was comfortable discussing her ADHD, and did not mind my curiosity.

    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people with mental illness are looked down upon. Those with depression are seen as seeking attention, and those with ADHD are seen as making excuses, all by those who truly believe that mental illness do not really exist. Then there are those who have difficulty understanding why someone would act or feel a certain way because they themselves never have, or those who think a mental illness should look a different way, and those suffering should act a certain way 100% of the time.</p>
