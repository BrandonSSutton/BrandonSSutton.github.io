                 cols = "100">&nbsp;&nbsp;January 25th, 2020, saturday night. There's a lot of speculations and preconceived notions of what it means to be schizophrenic. My experience tonight was minimal, I was sitting back in bed, watching some videos on YouTube on my TV. After I had watched somewhere around 8 videos, I noticed a small shadow creature on the wall just behind the TV, that resembles a spider from a video game I play known as Skyrim, A frost-spider is what they are called. These spiders are large, with a bluish black outter skeleton, and white hair protruding at its joints, They have large claws protruding from their mouth and can run at speeds greater than the games characters. However, The claws hanging from its mouth were missing in what I saw. While appearing in this form, the figure appeared to be smiling at me with an a human mouth and a face that was difficult to read. This hallucination although it seems like it is nothing special to the normal person and most would shrug it off as an overactive imagination, This is on the lower end of some of the things I have witnessed, but still very real to me. As this hallucination continued it morphed into the figure of spongebob, that is if spongebob could melt and had his eyes gouged out. With that part of his face was missing, the lower half of him was gone, and his arms seemed bent out of shape. I know what you are thinking, “Brandon this all sounds like you made this up, this can’t be real.” Oh but I assure you it was very real. Imagine seeing something like that multiple times a day every day, But wait,  it gets worse. With all of this having already having manifested its self right before my eyes, I have the luxury of seeing before me what I can only describe as a man with no face, floating on the wall, staring strait at me. How can he stair without a face? I suppose it is similar to how slenderman works.  This figure seemed to hang there for what felt like hours, however it was only in reality about 5 minutes. The entire time making no contact, no gestures, no sign of being real or fake. He simply just exsisted there. After the 5 minutes had passed, he seemed to fade away and shift back into the image of spongebob again, and then after a few seconds it slowly faded away into nothingness. While this is not a scary experience, I does make you have to think about if what I saw was really all in my head, or was it real and I was the only one that saw it. This looked as if it was the end of the hallucinations for the night, and so I preceded to watch a few more videos on youtube, and by 1am I decided it was time for bed. I got off my bed, brushed my teeth, and made sure that everything was in order for me to be able to get up and start working the next morning. As I laid down in bed, pulled my covers over me, closed my eyes and attempted to slip off into dream land, I saw one last thing that would scare most people right out of their skin. Right in front of me where a pair of eyes, and a mouth staring directly into mine, while inching closer and closer until I could feel this “being” right on top of me. I could not tell if this “being” ment harm or not, however, it has been a recurring hallucination. Though it does not happen every night, it happens a large number of them. This “being” just sits there, nose to nose with me, staring into my eyes and never makes a sound. As I stare back, there is unfortunately not much to see. It appears as if I am staring into an abyss, or a deep cavern  for which light never reaches. There are no pupils, nor an iris. Every now and then, the “being” appears with long hair, and a gray skin, a symmetrical face that resembles a woman, and dark, blackish gray irides. I never feel any breath from the creature being leaked out onto my skin. Even if I turn on my side, it does not matter, the “being” seems to float down in front of me, and assumes the same position as before. This will often persists for approximately 2-3 minutes, then just like the hallucinations before it, it dissipates into thin air.</textarea>
