                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I look back over the initial post I created, I realize that all though nothing about my message has changed, my approach has changed. My position started with trying to educate on the symptoms and signs of different mental illnesses, and where to turn if they need help. While that core position is still in place, I have evolved it a little bit. My mission is now more centered around making the information easily accessible rather than forcing an education upon someone. I chose the gentler route of creating a location in the offices of schools, where students and parents could go to obtain the information if they wanted too. There would by no means any requirement to do so, and it would still offer the opportunity to get proper information on an issue that so few people understand anything about. In doing this research, being able to see the stance of other people and seeing how vibrant the community dedicated to helping the mentally ill is, I have learned that my initial approach is wrong. So, what do I mean by that? Well the answer is difficult to explain. I have come to the understanding that a large number of people do not know what sources to trust, or where to begin in their research. Because of this, they often just believe the stigmas that others have. These stigmas can cause them to have preconceived notions of how someone with a mental illness is, and in some cases has been known to cause violence. While I still believe that my initial goal with this topic has not really changed, However, with the information I have uncovered, my initial method for tackling it has changed. I still believe that mental illness is a very serious topic and should not be taken lightly. And in doing the research necessary for this topic, I have found a plethora of documentation of research done by others on the topic. In my initial post I worked under the idea that this may be difficult to uncover information on, or if I did it would be worded in a manner that I may not understand. To my relief, many documented cases are written in a very clear, easy to read manner.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the semester, I have learned first and foremost that I still struggle with organizing my thoughts. Just about everything I say on paper comes out in a jumbled mess that is difficult for anyone but me to read. Though I feel I have become better at this, there is still room left to be desired, and hopefully I can straiten it up eventually. I have also learned better ways to word my sentences. I am in no way perfect, but before I would add information that felt as if it were unnecessary in one section when I should have used in a different section. I know that Kelly has be very adamant about how wonderful of a job we as a class had been doing on our blog posts, However, this does not really help us to evolve our writing styles, so I took it upon myself to ask an outside person to review the posts when they go up. You have no idea how many mistakes I make before any of you see these posts. While I am sure that some of you can probably guess, let me save you the trouble in saying it is a lot. As I have gone through my process, writing paper after paper, I have realized I tend to start in the middle of a paper, in fact this blog post is the first time in a very long time I started at the beginning of something I was writing. Usually if I attempt to begin with the introduction, I either do not explain enough, or I put way too much detail. I have learned to start with the body, then move onto the conclusion, only after that will I go back and write the intro. I do feel as if I have become better about citing my sources in text. In my profession, this is not a skill I use, however for a formal paper, it will be a great skill to have.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received a lot of feedback from a few people. The feedback I have received from my peers in the class has been helpful for the most part. Some of their suggestions have been towards the layout of my site, and while I have done what I can to improve it somewhat, I do not have the full knowledge on how to really make it much better. I really wish I could, but that will have to wait for another day. Other feedback I have received from peers mainly hit points of how they feel I could improve my research or asking if I could clarify what I was saying in a post. I really don’t mind these forms of feedback, they let me know that the people reading my posts genuinely want to learn more about the topic. Others have merely commended me on what I have in the posts. There has been some feed back from Kelli, mainly consisting of her concerns with how I word some of the posts. I do agree that maybe I need to be careful with how I word what I say. At some point I made a claim that I thought we could cure mental illness if there was enough widespread information. Kelli, pointed out that maybe saying there was a cure was a little bit a reach. I completely understood her position on the matter, and I reevaluated my scripture. I realized that perhaps saying there could be a cure was misleading, so instead I changed my perspective and wrote that there could be improved treatments. Those may not have been my exact words I used, however, that was the basic idea of what I said. The feedback I received from a friend I shared the blog with showed me that although he agreed with my initial message, he felt as if I was being a tad aggressive, or at least I was in the beginning. He was not wrong, and so I have worked on coming across as less aggressive while still attempting to press the significance of the matter. I feel as If I have done a decent job of doing so. If you feel otherwise, please do not hesitate to let me know. Just be sure to explain why you feel that way so I can understand and adjust accordingly.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this is the last post I will be making on here, it is my hope that I have taught someone at least something that would help them in the long run. I would also like to add that after the semester is over, I will be removing this blog from the internet as I will no longer have any use for it. I do not want to use it for professional reasons, and I may need to use the website for a class in the future, to do so I would have to alter just about everything the site has to offer. Thankyou for reading and I hope the rest of your semester goes well.<p ALIGN=RIGHT>April, 25</p>
